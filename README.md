# loan_defaulter

This project aims to help financial institutions identify potential loan defaulters before issuing credit. By analyzing historical loan data, we uncover patterns and risk factors that contribute to default behavior. The goal is to build a predictive model that flags high-risk applicants, enabling smarter lending decisions and reducing financial losses.

## Objectives

Understand key indicators of loan default (e.g., income, credit history, loan amount).

Build a machine learning model to predict default risk.

Provide actionable insights for loan approval strategies.
